Syncany Hubic Plugin
--------------------
This plugin uses [Hubic](http://www.hubic.com) as a storage backend for [Syncany](http://www.syncany.org). The plugin can be installed in Syncany using the `sy plugin install` command. For further information about the usage, please refer to the central **[wiki page](https://github.com/binwiederhier/syncany/wiki)**.

This project references the syncany project as a multi-project build.  It is assumed that the syncany project is in the same directory as this project.
If it is not then you will need to edit the projectDir paths in the settings.gradle file.

For plugin development, please refer to the [plugin development wiki page](https://github.com/binwiederhier/syncany/wiki/Plugin-development).
